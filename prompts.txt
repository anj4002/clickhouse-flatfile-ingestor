4. What’s a secure and scalable way to handle JWT token-based authentication for ClickHouse connections?

5. How can I extract only the schema (column names) from a CSV without reading the entire file into memory?

6. What’s the most user-friendly approach to let users select only specific columns they want to ingest?

7. How can I display the number of records ingested and optionally preview a few rows to confirm successful ingestion?

8. How can I surface backend errors clearly to the frontend without overwhelming non-technical users?

9. What’s a good method to validate that ClickHouse actually received the ingested data correctly?

10. How do I ensure local flat file paths (like on Windows) are interpreted correctly by the backend?

11. Would a data preview feature help users verify input before ingestion, and how can I implement it efficiently?

12. What’s the most modular way to support both ClickHouse → Flat File and Flat File → ClickHouse flows in one tool?
